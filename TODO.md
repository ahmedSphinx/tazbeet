# Mood Tracking Services Fixes and Upgrades

## Issues to Fix

- [x] **Channel Mismatch**: Update NotificationService to use dedicated 'mood_check_ins' channel instead of 'task_reminders'
- [x] **Redundant Scheduling**: Simplify scheduleMoodCheckInNotifications to remove manual 7-day loop (matchDateTimeComponents handles repetition)
- [x] **Default Inconsistency**: Fix enableMoodNotifications default to false consistently in SettingsService
- [x] **Background Support**: Added rescheduleMoodNotifications method for reliability

## Upgrades

- [x] **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and logging in notification scheduling
- [x] **Time Validation**: Added validation for mood check-in times format and range in SettingsService
- [x] **Timezone Handling**: Ensured proper timezone configuration for scheduling
- [x] **Notification Tracking**: Added getPendingMoodNotifications and rescheduleMoodNotifications methods
- [x] **Localization**: Applied AppLocalizations to mood settings UI strings
- [x] **Testing**: Analyzed code for errors (passed), notification logic verified

## Implementation Steps

1. [x] Update NotificationService.scheduleMoodCheckInNotifications()
2. [x] Update SettingsService defaults and validation
3. [x] Add background service support methods
4. [x] Apply AppLocalizations to UI strings
5. [x] Test all functionality (code analysis passed)
6. [ ] Update documentation
