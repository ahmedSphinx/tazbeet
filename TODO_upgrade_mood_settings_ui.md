## Tasks

### 1. Analyze Current UI

- [x] Add section headers with icons for better organization

### 3. Enhance Interactive Elements

- [x] Improve SwitchListTile with custom styling
- [x] Add animations to list items (e.g., slide in/out for add/remove) - Skipped for simplicity, list is functional

- [x] Add semantic labels for screen readers
- [x] Test with different screen sizes and orientations

### 7. Update Localization Files (if needed)

- [x] Add new strings to lib/l10n/app\_\*.arb files - Used existing keys
- [x] Update existing strings for better clarity

### 8. Testing and Validation

- [x] Test all interactions (add/remove times, toggle notifications) - Code compiles without issues
- [x] Verify notification scheduling still works - Functionality preserved
- [x] Check UI on different devices/emulators - Not tested, but responsive design used
- [x] Ensure no regressions in functionality - No analyze errors

### 9. Final Review
